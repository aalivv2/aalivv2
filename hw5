Abstract:
There are include to things:
1)	Abstract class 
2)	Interface(implements)

          Abstract class:
abstract class called Abstract by its keyword and cannot change by programmer , and It cannot be instantiated, also, can have constructors and static methods , and can have non- Abstract method in class Abstract , method abstract doesn’t have body, when contain abstract class and other class you must write word(extends) ,cannot be used to create object , so, cannot have constructor ,
       For example in abstract class:  abstract class student{}
for example in abstract method:  abstract void grade();

        Interface(implements) :
           - word write(implements) (interface) 
          - the implement keyword its implement an interface
         - the interface keyword its used class only of abstract method 
          - it cannot be used to create objects so, interface cannot contain constructor.
            -the interface method doesn’t have the body because the body implement the another class
         -  interface attributes can public , static , final
        - interface method can abstract and public 
         - when implementation of an interface you must override all method in another class 
         - and you can create multiple interfaces and implementation the class for example:
            Interface car{}
            Interface bike{}
          Class human implements car , bike{}
